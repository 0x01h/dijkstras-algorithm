# Random Graph Generator with Dijkstra's Algorithm
Random graph generator using 4D array with layered system and also **Dijkstra's algorithm** implementation to find shortest path distance.<br>
Users can choose their parameters to determine node sizes and minimum, maximum lengths between two nodes.<br>
Also, you can track the CPU usage and computation time of the algorithm to evaluate its performance.
