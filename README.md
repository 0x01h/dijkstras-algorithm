# Random Graph Generator with Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm implementation to find shortest path distance using random graph generator on 4D array layered graph system.

Users can choose input parameters to determine node sizes and maximum lengths between two nodes.

Parameters:
- Number of layers.
- Number of nodes for each layer.
- Maximum length between two nodes.
- How many times do you want the algorithm works?
